## File Naming
*add text about standardized file naming* 

## Shared Drive Files

### General Structure

```
Google Drive
  |__ My Drive
  |   |__ Whatever files you have on your GoogleDrive
  |__ Shared drives
      |__ emLab
          |__ Central emLab Resources
          |__ Communications
          |__ Data
          |__ Projects
```

The emLab Shared Drive is organized into four main folders:
* Central emLab Resources: includes meeting and event information, onboarding materials, information about travel reimbursements, and the team roster
* Communications: includes the blog schedule, Adobe design projects, PowerPoint templates, photo repository, and publication and media tracking
* Data: will include the emLab data directory and all datasets we work with
* Projects: includes information on past and current projects, and project management guidelines

A full table of contents can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a26a6N4akF2dSXWfp0fWxGegd0wvrPVUeaA09en2EPE/edit). 

### Project Folder Structure

```
Google Drive
  |__ Shared drives
      |__ emLab
          |__ Projects
              |__ Archived Projects
              |__ Current Projects
                  |__ Project Example
                      |__ Data
                      |__ Deliverables
                      |__ Grant Reporting
                      |__ Meetings and Events
                      |__ Presentations
                      |__ Project Materials
              |__ Resources
```

Each project folder must contain the following 6 folders:

* Data: all input/raw data will live in the `emLab/Data` folder. This data folder will contain all intermediate datasets as well as output datasets. Be sure to also add a copy of your final datasets to the `emLab/Data` folder and data directory.
* Deliverables: final reports, paper manuscripts, other final deliverables not related to data outputs
* Grant Reporting: grant reports for funders 
* Meetings and Events: meeting notes, agendas, documentation for workshop/event planning
* Presentations: any presentations created for the project
* Project Materials: everything else that does not fit into one of these folders (i.e. drafts of methods, literature review, etc.)

From here, each project can add sub-folders as they see fit within these 6 folders.

### Data Storage

<!--
    Note: update this text to match our last conversation. All inputs and outputs will live in the emLab/Data folder. Under each project, there will also be a data folder where intermediate files can be stored. the final output can be shared here as well, but needs to also be added to the emLab/Data folder and data directory. 
-->

Data from all projects will be stored in the `Data` directory of our emLab shared drive. Some data will be of general interest to different projects (for example, the "Upsides database"), while some data may be relevant to just one project (*e.g.* lobster landings for November 2014 in Montserrat Island). As such, data should be stored in the appropriate folders. Data of general interest will be sotred under a `Data/shared/` folder, subsequently divided as needed. Data relevant to only a few projects will be stored under `Data/project_name`. The name of this project should match the name of the project, as defined in the [emLab Shared Drive Structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a26a6N4akF2dSXWfp0fWxGegd0wvrPVUeaA09en2EPE).

#### `Data/shared`

The data living under `Data/shares` will often be the product of previous projects, or clean raw data obtained from data providers. For example, the "upsides database" is the product of the [Costello *et al.* 2016 paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/18/5125). On the other hand, the RAM Legacy stock assessment database is often shared with us by the [RAM Legacy team](https://www.ramlegacy.org/). Therefore, when a project uses thes data as input, we make no distinction between "raw" and "processed" data, and treat all data in this folder as "raw data". This means that these data should not be modified or updated by projects. When needed, updated versions of some data may become available.

#### Project-specific data

For project-specific cases, however, the teams will often receive data from partners, compile it from multiple sources, use survey responses, or extract it from a literature review. These data are termed "raw data", and should **never** be directly modified -all the errors, mistakes, and gremlins should be kept in the original versions. Instead, they should be processed / cleaned, and then exported as "clean data", that can be used in analyses.

For example, suppose that a team working in Montserrat receives a database of lobster landings by the government. These data are stored as an excel spreadsheet, and will surely contain many mistakes and errors that need to be fixed. The team will clean the data (preferabily, using a reproducible script), and then export it to a different location within the project folder. Therefore, the project-level data folders will be divided into `raw_data` and `data` folders. The first one will contain all raw data as-is. The second folder will contain clean data, whcich can then be used as input for analyses.

#### General structure of the `Data` folder
