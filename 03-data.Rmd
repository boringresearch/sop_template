# Data

Data should be managed and shared properly to make it useful in research, to promote transparency and facilitate reproducibility, and to ensure the credibility of research. This includes such practices as transforming data into a tidy format, storing data in open file formats, and providing data documentation. **All emLab data, unless restricted, should be stored in the emLab Shared Drive (location dependent on type of data, see Section 2.2.3).**

## Data File Naming

"Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread" - Hadley Wickham

Coding styles guides provide teams with a shared language that promotes consistency, improves collaboration, and makes code easier to write as it simplifies the number of decisions we need to make on a daily basis (e.g., do I use - or _ to name this file? ). 

All style guides are opinionated and while they all intend to make code easier to read and write, some decisions are arbitrary. Thus, instead of us at emLab creating our own, we want to adopt the "proven and tested" [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). This styles guide has good advice not only for naming files but also for naming functions, objects, and general best coding practices. We encourage all emLab members to read the guide and work towards adopting it. 

When it comes to file naming, best practices include: 

  - Names should be descriptive and meaningful. Many coding interfaces now have autocompletion tools, so the length of the filename is less of a concern. 
  - Avoid spaces and upper case letters. Some operating systems are case sensitive so in the interest of collaboration, let's use only **only** lower case. 
  - Use `_` to separate words in filenames. Do not use `-`, `.`, or any other special characters. 
  - Strive to use verbs for function names. 
  - If files should be run in a particular order, prefix them with numbers. If you’ll have more than 10 files left pad with zero (e.g., 01_get_data.R)

<!-- add file name examples? -->

## Metadata

Metadata is data about your data. It includes information about your data's content, structure, authors, and permissions to make your data interpretable and usable by your future self and others. EVERY data file should be accompanied by a metadata file.

### Metadata Standards

We use "readme" style metadata, named `_readme_datafilename`, and stored in the same folder as the data file.  

* Create one readme file for each data file. Download and use this [template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AmB69bCh4wqnZFdYuzcXR6R3cKpyUfDT) to create your readme file (when one is not already available).

* Name the readme `_readme_datafilename` and save as a text file.

* Format the readme so it is easy to understand (use bullets, break up information, etc.)

* Use a standardized date format (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Where to store metadata

All readme metadata files are stored in the folder that contains the data file in the [emLab Data Directory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lCzpP1X0qPQrqDzVBi78XJQVUumbcQqRck60OkHtANk/edit#gid=0).

## Data Directory 

All emLab data is stored in subfolders of the Data folder on the emLab Team Drive (`emlab/data`). To document these data, we use the [emLab Data Directory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lCzpP1X0qPQrqDzVBi78XJQVUumbcQqRck60OkHtANk/edit#gid=0) that includes key, standardized information from each readme metadata file. Every data file in the `emlab/data` folder has a record (row) in the emLab Data Directory. The emLab Data Directory file contains two sheets: (1) Data directory (the record and standardized documentation for each data file); (2) Metadata (information needed to populate the Data Directory, i.e. the meta-metadata)

```{r render meta_metadata table, results= 'asis', echo = F, message = F, warning=F}
require(tidyverse)
require(knitr)

meta_metadatatable <- read_csv("images/meta_metadata.csv", col_names = F)
colnames(meta_metadatatable) <- c("Column","Description")
kable(meta_metadatatable)
```

## Tidy Data  

As researchers, we work with data from many different sources. Often these data are messy. One of the first steps of any analysis is to clean any available raw data so that you can make simple visualizations of the data, calculate simple summary statistics, look for missing or incorrect data, and eventually proceed with more involved analyses or modeling.

As part of the data cleaning process, we recommend getting all data into a "tidy" format (also known as "long" format, as opposed to "wide" format). According to the [Tidy Data Guide](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, tidy data is defined as:

<blockquote>
* Each variable must have its own column.  
* Each observation must have its own row.  
* Each value must have its own cell.  
</blockquote>

These three features of tidy data can be seen in the following figure, also from the [Tidy Data Guide](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html):

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

Once data are in this format, it makes subsequent visualization and analysis much easier. If you've ever worked with a file that has a separate column for each year (an example of "wide" format data), you know how hard that type of data format is to work with!  

As always, we recommend keeping a backup copy of the raw data you obtained from the original source, and using a reproducible script for transforming these data into a tidy data format.

### Recommended Resources  

We highly recommend the chapter on [Tidy Data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) from the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This guide is geared towards R users and provides helpful tips for transforming and working with data in R, but the concepts should be broadly applicable to other languages as well. For tips specific to Python, we recommend a blogpost by Jean-Nicholas Hould titled [Tidy Data in Python](http://www.jeannicholashould.com/tidy-data-in-python.html).
