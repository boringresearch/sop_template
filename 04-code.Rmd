# Code

All data processing and analysis should be performed with code (i.e., avoid spreadsheets), and all code should be packaged in scripts that are version controlled and follow a style guide. Using code and scripts allows for better organization, documentation, and reproducibility of analysis workflows.

## Scripts and Version Control

Code should be crafted according to the following guidelines:

* Use scripts  
* Document scripts, but not too much  
* Organize scripts consistently (see format below)    
* Use Git to version control scripts  
* Make atomic Git commits (see description below)  

Script files should be documented and organized in such a way to enhance readability and comprehension. For example, use a standardized header for general documentation and sections to make it easier to understand and find specific code of interest. Code should also be self-documenting as much as possible. Additionally, use relative filepaths for importing and exporting objects. Scripts should also be modular by focusing on one general task. For example, use one script for cleaning data, another script for visualizing data, etc. A makefile can then be used to document the analysis workflow. There is an art to this organization, so just keep in mind the general principle of making code easy to understand, for your future self and for others.

Here is an example template for R scripts:

```
# =============================================================================
# Name:           script.R
# Description:    Visualizes data
# 
# Inputs:         data.csv
# Outputs:        graph.png
# 
# Notes:          - Use a diverging color palette for best results
#                 - Output format can be changed as needed
# =============================================================================


# Set up environment ----------------------------------------------------------

library(tidyverse)

# Set path for Google Drive filestream based on OS type
team_path <- case_when(Sys.info()["sysname"]=="Windows" ~ "G:/",
                       Sys.info()["sysname"]=="Darwin" ~ "/Volumes/GoogleDrive/")


# Import data -----------------------------------------------------------------


# Process data ----------------------------------------------------------------


# Analyze data ----------------------------------------------------------------


# Visualize results -----------------------------------------------------------


# Save results ----------------------------------------------------------------


```

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) tracks changes in code line-by-line with the use of commits. Commits should be atomic by documenting single, specific changes in code as opposed to multiple, unrelated changes. Atomic commits can be small or large depending on the change being made, and they enable easier code review and reversion. Git commit messages should be informative and follow a certain style, such as the guide found [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). There is also an art to the version control process, so just keep in mind the general principle of making atomic commits.

emLab uses [GitHub](https://github.com/emlab-ucsb) to host Git repos in the cloud, which makes collaborative code development easier and also provides related project management tools. Repos can be public or private, depending on the nature of the project. Furthermore, workflows for Git and GitHub, such as using pull requests or branches, will vary from project to project. It is important that the members of each project agree to and follow a specific workflow to ensure that collaboration is effective and efficient.


## Style Guide  

At emLab, we recommend using a consistent code style for each of the different programming languages we use. Recommended coding styles for a particular language are collated in what is known as a "style guide". Style guides typically include standardized ways of naming script files, defining functions and variables, commenting code, etc. While emLab does not mandate the use of style guides, having a consistent code style allows all emLab staff to easily understand each other's code, collaborate on projects, and jump in on new projects. We consider this an important aspect of collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency.  

Rather than re-invent the wheel, we leverage existing code style guidelines for each of the languages we use. Below is a summary of the code style guidelines we recommend for various languages:  

* *R* - [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org), by Hadley Wickham  
* *Python* - [Google's Python Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md)  
* *Stata* - [Suggestions on Stata programming style](https://www.stata-journal.com/sjpdf.html?articlenum=pr0018), by Nicolas J. Cox  
* *Other languages* - [Google style guides for other languages](https://github.com/google/styleguide)
