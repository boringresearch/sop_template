# Code

All data processing and analysis should be performed with code (i.e., avoid spreadsheets), and all code should be packaged in scripts that are version controlled and follow a style guide. Using code and scripts allows for better organization, documentation, and reproducibility of analysis workflows. **All emLab code should be stored in the emLab GitHub account.**

## Scripts and Version Control {#scripts-and-version-control}

Code should be crafted according to the following guidelines:

* Use scripts  
* Document scripts, but not too much  
* Organize scripts consistently (see format below)    
* Use Git to version control scripts  
* Make atomic Git commits (see description below)  

Script files should be documented and organized in such a way to enhance readability and comprehension. For example, use a standardized header for general documentation and sections to make it easier to understand and find specific code of interest. Code should also be self-documenting as much as possible. Additionally, use relative filepaths for importing and exporting objects. Scripts should also be modular by focusing on one general task. For example, use one script for cleaning data, another script for visualizing data, etc. A makefile can then be used to document the analysis workflow. There is an art to this organization, so just keep in mind the general principle of making code easy to understand, for your future self and for others.

Here is an example template for R scripts:

```
# =============================================================================
# Name:           script.R
# Description:    Visualizes data
# 
# Inputs:         data.csv
# Outputs:        graph.png
# 
# Notes:          - Use a diverging color palette for best results
#                 - Output format can be changed as needed
# =============================================================================


# Set up environment ----------------------------------------------------------

library(tidyverse)

# Set path for Google Drive filestream based on OS type
# Note - this will work for Windows and Mac machines.
# If you use Linux, you will need to set your own path to where Google Drive filestream lives.

team_path <- ifelse(Sys.info()["sysname"]=="Windows","G:/","/Volumes/GoogleDrive/")

# Next, set the path for data directory based on whether project is current or archived.
# Note that if you use a different Shared Drive file structure than the one recommended in the "File Structure" section, you will need to manually define your data path.
# You should always double-check the automatically generated paths in order to ensure they point to the correct directory.

# First, set the name of your project

project_name <- "my-project"

# This will automatically determine if the project exists in the "current-projects" or "archived-projects" Shared Drive folder, and set the appropriate data path accordingly.
data_path <- ifelse(dir.exists(paste0(team_path,"Shared drives/emlab/projects/current-projects/",project_name)),
                       paste0(team_path,"Shared drives/emlab/projects/current-projects/",project_name,"/data/"),
                       (paste0(team_path,"Shared drives/emlab/projects/archived-projects/",project_name,"/data/")))


# Import data -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Load data from Shared Drive using appropriate data path
my_raw_data <- read_csv(paste0(data_path,"raw/my_raw_data.csv"))

# Process data ----------------------------------------------------------------


# Analyze data ----------------------------------------------------------------


# Visualize results -----------------------------------------------------------


# Save results ----------------------------------------------------------------


```

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) tracks changes in code line-by-line with the use of commits. Commits should be atomic by documenting single, specific changes in code as opposed to multiple, unrelated changes. Atomic commits can be small or large depending on the change being made, and they enable easier code review and reversion. Git commit messages should be informative and follow a certain style, such as the guide found [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). There is also an art to the version control process, so just keep in mind the general principle of making atomic commits.

More advanced workflows for using Git and GitHub, such as using pull requests or branches, will vary from project to project. It is important that the members of each project agree to and follow a specific workflow to ensure that collaboration is effective and efficient.

## Style Guide  

At emLab, we recommend using a consistent code style for each of the different programming languages we use. Recommended coding styles for a particular language are collated in what is known as a "style guide". Style guides typically include standardized ways of naming script files, defining functions and variables, commenting code, etc. While emLab does not mandate the use of style guides, having a consistent code style allows all emLab staff to easily understand each other's code, collaborate on projects, and jump in on new projects. We consider this an important aspect of collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency.  

Rather than re-invent the wheel, we leverage existing code style guidelines for each of the languages we use. Below is a summary of the code style guidelines we recommend for various languages:  

* *R* - [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org), by Hadley Wickham  
* *Python* - [Google's Python Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md)  
* *Stata* - [Suggestions on Stata programming style](https://www.stata-journal.com/sjpdf.html?articlenum=pr0018), by Nicolas J. Cox  
* *Other languages* - [Google style guides for other languages](https://github.com/google/styleguide)  

## Reproducibility 

Prioritizing reproducibility when writing code code not only fosters collaboration with others during a project, but also makes it easier for users in the future (including yourself!) to make changes and rerun analyses as new data become available. Some useful tools and practices include:

- **Commenting code:** Adding brief but detailed comments to your scripts that document what your code does and how it works will help others understand and use your scripts. At the top of your scripts, describe the purpose of the code as well as its necessary inputs, required packages, and outputs.   
- **File paths:** Avoid writing file paths that only work on your computer. Where possible, use relative file paths instead of absolute files paths so your code can be run by different users or operating systems. For R users, using [R Projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) and/or the [here](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) package are great ways to help implement this practice.
- **Functions:** If you find yourself copying and pasting similar blocks of code over and over to repeat tasks, turn it into a function!
- **R Markdown:** R users can take advantage of [R  Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) for a coding format that seamlessly integrates sections of text alongside code chunks. R Markdown also enables you to transform your code and text into report-friendly formats such as PDFs or Word documents. 
- **Git and GitHub:** [As described above,](#scripts-and-version-control) Git tracks changes to files line-by-line in commits that are attributable to each team member working on the project. GitHub then compiles the history of any Git-tracked file online, and synchronizes the work of all collaborators in a central repository. Using Git and GitHub allow multiple people to code collaboratively, examine changes as they occur, and restore prior versions of files if necessary.
