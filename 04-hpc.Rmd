# High Performance Computing

Certain use cases require high performance computing resources:

  * big data
  * parallel computing
  * lengthy computation times
  * restricted-use data

For analyses involving big data or models that take a long time to estimate, a single laptop or desktop computer is often not powerful enough or becomes inconvenient to use. Additionally, for analyses involving restricted-use data, such as datasets containing personally identifiable information, data use agreements typically stipulate that the data should be stored and analyzed in a secure manner.

In these cases, you should use the high performance computing resources available to emLab, including cloud computing through Google Cloud Platform and the UCSB server clusters. Cloud computing incurs costs but is flexible whereas the UCSB server clusters are free but have some limitations.


## Google Cloud Platform




## UCSB Server Clusters

The Center for Scientific Computing at UCSB provides resources and support for research involving high performance computing, including multiple server clusters for storing and analyzing data. Find out more information at <http://csc.cnsi.ucsb.edu/>.

The clusters should be used if cloud computing costs are a concern. The cluster computing resources are free to emLab researchers, but they are a shared resource among UCSB researchers and involve job queues that can potentially delay analyses. However, most of the analyses typical of emLab projects require a small amount of resources relative to other users of the clusters.

Additionally, the clusters should typically be used if using restricted-use data in research, though this depends on the terms of the data use agreement. Be sure to restrict access to any sensitive data on the clusters by changing the folder and file permissions appropriately.

Some data providers may prefer to use cloud computing services for sensitive data because it may give them greater control over the uses of their data. If needed, these issues about where data can be stored and analyzed should be negotiated and resolved in data use agreements.

A user guide for the clusters can be found at <https://emlab-ucsb.github.io/cluster-guide/>.
